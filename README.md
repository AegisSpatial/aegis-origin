## About AEGIS

The AEGIS framework is a geospatial toolkit developed within a running R&D project at ELTE Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Informatics, which aims to research new approaches in geospatial data management. It supports several kinds of geospatial data, including vector datasets, raster imagery and point clouds.
AEGIS is a platform independent library, implemented as .NET Standard library to exploit the wide possibilities and the simple usage of this object-oriented development platform.

AEGIS has been developed by taking adaptability and extensibility in mind. It employs state of the art programming methodologies and contains possible realizations of well-known standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The component-based infrastructure enables the separation of working fields and the interchangeability of data models, methods and algorithms. The extensibility also enables marrying AEGIS with existing toolkits after the implementation of the proper wrappers for processing environment and data model.
